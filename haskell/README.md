A symbolic model checker for [Dynamic Epistemic Logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dynamic-epistemic).

You can find a complete literate Haskell documentation in the file
[SMCDEL.pdf](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/raw/master/SMCDEL.pdf).

## Online

You can try SMCDEL online here: https://w4eg.de/malvin/illc/smcdelweb/


## Dependencies

- [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
- [dot2tex](https://github.com/kjellmf/dot2tex)

On Debian, just do `sudo apt install graphviz dot2tex`.


## Basic usage

1) Use *stack* from https://www.stackage.org

- `stack build` will compile everything. This might fail if one of
  the BDD packages written in C and C++ is missing. In this case,
  install those manually and then try `stack build` again.

- `stack install` will put two executables `smcdel` and `smcdel-web`
  into ~/.local/bin which should be in your `PATH` variable.

2) Create a text file `MuddyShort.smcdel.txt` which describes the knowledge structure and the formulas you want to check for truth or validity:

    ```
    -- Three Muddy Children in SMCDEL
    VARS 1,2,3
    LAW  Top
    OBS  alice: 2,3
         bob:   1,3
         carol: 1,2
    WHERE?
      [ ! (1|2|3) ] alice knows whether 1
    VALID?
      [ ! (1|2|3) ]
      [ ! ((~ (alice knows whether 1)) & (~ (bob knows whether 2)) & (~ (carol knows whether 3))) ]
      [ ! ((~ (alice knows whether 1)) & (~ (bob knows whether 2)) & (~ (carol knows whether 3))) ]
      (alice,bob,carol) comknow that (1 & 2 & 3)
    ```

3) Run `smcdel MuddyShort.smcdel.txt` resulting in:

    ```
    >> smcdel MuddyShort.smcdel.txt
    SMCDEL 1.0 by Malvin Gattinger -- https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL

    At which states is ... true?
    []
    [1]

    Is ... valid on the given structure?
    True
    ```

    More example files are in the folder [Examples](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/tree/master/Examples).

4) To use the web interface run `smcdel-web` and then open <http://localhost:3000/index.html>.


## Advanced usage

To deal with more complex models and formulas, use SMCDEL as a Haskell module.

Examples can be found in the folders
  [src/SMCDEL/Examples](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/tree/master/src/SMCDEL/Examples)
and
  [bench](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/tree/master/bench).


## Used BDD packages

SMCDEL can be used with different BDD packages. To compile and
run the benchmarks you will have to install all of them.

- [Data.HasCacBDD](https://github.com/m4lvin/HasCacBDD) which runs CacBDD from <http://kailesu.net/CacBDD/>
- [Cudd](https://github.com/davidcock/cudd) ([with some patches](https://github.com/m4lvin/cudd))
